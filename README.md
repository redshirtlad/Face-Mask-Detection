Face Mask Detection System
This repository contains a Face Mask Detection System built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with the MobileNetV2 pre-trained model. This system detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time.

Overview
The system uses a MobileNetV2 backbone for feature extraction, fine-tuned on a dataset of face images with and without masks. It can process images or video streams and classify faces into two categories:

With Mask
Without Mask
Features
Efficient and lightweight architecture using MobileNetV2.
Real-time face detection and mask classification.
High accuracy on test datasets.
Compatible with webcam, IP cameras, or video files.
Dataset
The dataset used includes face images with and without masks, preprocessed to be compatible with the MobileNetV2 model.
